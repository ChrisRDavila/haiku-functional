1: Syllable formed by at least one vowel. Silent e not counted as vowel. When two vowels carry one sound, can't be split ("coin", beau-ti-ful). Y is wonky sometimes

2: Divide syllable between two same consonants eg rab-bit, let-ter, buf-fet etc

3: long/short vowel sound. Consonant goes with second vowel if first vowel has long vowel sound eg ba-sic, ro-bot etc. The consonant goes with first vowel if first vowel has short vowel sound eg riv-er, mod-el. Exception, never split two consonants that make one sound eg ch, sh, ph, th, wh & gh when pronounced together and aren't same letter

4: Divide between two vowels that make two sounds eg di-et. Exception, two vowels make one sound eg coat, boat, meet

5: Use prefixes and suffixes to separate syllables. eg re-turn, un-u-su-al, pre-pad, end-less, pay-ing etc

6: Compound nouns are always divided between the two words. Example: some-thing, cup-cake, with-out, how-ev-er, ba-by-sit-ter, class-room, break-fast, sun-flow-er.

7:Divide before the consonant before an "le" syllable and sounds like "el". For example: a-ble, can-dle,fum-ble, ap-ple, ta-ble, cas-tle.


//STARTING HERE/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Check if word is three letters or less, if so, 1 syllable (check length of word, create array if needed)
Count vowel groups, they usually count as one syllable (have list of vowels, make comparison somehow?)
End of word 'e' is often silent, unless le (check length-1 and length-2)
End of word ends in y += 1 syllable
prefix and suffix usually count as syllables (hard code some prefixes and suffixes to check)
